![Introduction](11HapticWingsIntroduction.png)

Hello everyone, I'd like to introduce the HapticWings project. This project is **a company-supported project.** A Korean company, MIMETICS, collaborated with our group, the Immersive Design Group in the School of Design at SUSTech. In this project, I mainly focus on **product and structure design.** 

Currently, I have compiled some images, and I will add explanations in the future.

## Research
